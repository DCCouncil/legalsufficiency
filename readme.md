Under the Council Rules, a written legal sufficiency determination must be prepared by the General Counsel for any measure approved by a Council committee, emergency measures, and amendments offered to bills on final reading.

Before 2015, this involved the creation of many Word documents, emailed to and fro with edits and multiple lost versions with ample opportunity for error. Now, it involves a web form with a straightforward draft-review-publish workflow. As a bonus, it publishes the final, approved sufficiencies directly to the web.
